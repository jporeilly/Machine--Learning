ML - Credit Card Fraud
Whether you are an ecommerce shop or sell digital services, you are most likely a high risk target for credit card related fraud.
Prevent payments from stolen cards, block unauthorized transactions & cut back card not present (CNP) fraud to grow your business safely.

In fraud detection the data and scenarios are changing faster than a rules based system can keep track of, leading to a rise in false positive and false negative rates which is making these systems no longer useful. The increasing volume of data can mire down a rules based system, while machine learning gets smarter as it processes more data.  Machine Learning can solve this problem since it is probabilistic and uses statistical models rather than deterministic rules. The machine learning models need to be trained using historic data. The creation of rules is replaced by the engineering of features which are input variables related to trends in historic data. In a world where data sources, compute platforms, and use cases are changing rapidly, unexpected changes in data structure and semantics (known as data drift) require a DataOps platform like Pentaho Machine Learning Orchestration to ensure the efficiency and effectiveness of Machine learning.
